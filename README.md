**IMPORTANT NOTE TO SELF**: PRs on the following open source issues are *Work in Progress* (I asked to work on them and got go ahead from repo maintainer) so finish these (in order of most to least finished/work done till now):
- *C++, Windows*: [Notepad++: fit popup window to screen height](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/14430#issuecomment-2629111330) 
- *Haskell*: [tldr-hs: Add --list argument to list all pages](https://github.com/psibi/tldr-hs/issues/47)
- *Rust*: [Rustup: Show installed path of Rust components (sources, docs, Clippy)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3382)

Additional:
- WAITING TO BE ASSIGNED (LLM/DS/AI/ML repo -- exactly the kind I *should* contribute to for help in my career!!) - https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/8700

##### Open Source TODO

- **IMPORTANT NOTE TO SELF**: start contributing regularly to Astral's projects as they seem to offer very well paid remote jobs! Their projects are:
  - `uv`: python build tool
  - `ruff`: python linter
  - `ty`: static type checker
  - `pyx`: package registry
- [`ptghci`](https://github.com/litxio/ptghci/) repo seems abandoned (last commit in 2022) - fork & start working on it.
*Haskell* also has a significant community likely to be interested, so big plus! 

#### 🛠️ Projects
- [IForth](https://github.com/sohang3112/iforth): It's a Jupyter kernel for [Forth programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)), so it allows you to run Forth code in Jupyter notebooks. I forked it from an abandoned repo and added features like syntax highlighting, better error handling, uploading to PyPI, etc.

**Note:** All my projects' statuses are noted [here](https://github.com/sohang3112/sohang3112.github.io/issues/9).

#### 🌱 Learning
Currently pursuing Master of Technology (Industrial Artificial Intelligence) at IIT Madras alongside job at HCL Technologies.
In addition:

- I'm learning Rust and solved all [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.
- I am also learning Clojure using [Exercism.io](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure) exercises.
